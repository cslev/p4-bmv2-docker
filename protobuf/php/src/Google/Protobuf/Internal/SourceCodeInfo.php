     * A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which
     * corresponds to a particular definition.  This information is intended
     * to be useful to IDEs, code indexers, documentation generators, and similar
     * tools.
     * For example, say we have a file like:
     *   message Foo {
     *     optional string foo = 1;
     *   }
     * Let's look at just the field definition:
     *   optional string foo = 1;
     *   ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
     *   a       bc     de  f  ghi
     * We have the following locations:
     *   span   path               represents
     *   [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
     *   [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).
     *   [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).
     *   [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).
     *   [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).
     * Notes:
     * - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
     *   particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
     *   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
     *   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
     *   have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
     *   field without an index.
     * - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
     *   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
     *   obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
     *   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
     * - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
     *   example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
     *   beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
     *   the block.
     * - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
     *   does not mean that it is a descendent.  For example, a "group" defines
     *   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
     *   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
     * - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
     *   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
     *   be recorded in the future.
